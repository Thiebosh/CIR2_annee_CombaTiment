# Presentation of the game (scenario):
## Intro kinematics

Inert building is equipped with a personal assistant (artificial intelligence). He thus becomes aware of himself and wants to gain in intelligence, independence, autonomy and control over himself (**clearly define the pillars of the intelligent building**).

To do this, it locates several sectors (one per pillar), where it will have to recycle non-intelligent elements, in order to replace them with the "intelligent" modules obtained as a reward, in case of success.

Then, he is put arms and legs in order to be able to move and fight to gain a generalized independence and to take care of the inhabitants.

**Purpose:** Presentation of the pillars values ​​of intelligent building and anchoring of the scenario in reality.



## How the game works:
### Alternate action / awareness

#### Panel 1: Contemplative & informative
The player arrives on a first screen where he sees his building in housing format, allowing him to see the interest of the improvements obtained in-game in real life.

#### Panel 2: Sector Selection & Getting Started
He can then go to the menu of choice of the sector. Each sector is linked to a pillar and is located in a place related to it - possibilities: factory, lab, experimental center, dump, school, warehouse ... In the presentation of the sector, we see the pillar and the improvements at stake with a brief explanation of what they bring to the player (combat skill / home improvement). This menu is also an opportunity to test the orders, through the building under challenger / Mecha format strolling at the bottom of the screen and a box showing the controls.

#### Panel 3: Defouloir & fun (heart of the game)
Once the sector selected, the player is faced with a wave of very weak enemies, followed by a boss of end of level, representing the elements of the daily to be recycled (to destroy) to leave room for the improvement obtained at the end level.

**Message from the action part:** The player finds himself recycling a non-exhaustive list of elements that go against the smart building and replace them with their "smart" equivalent. Through the game, he associates the idea that these elements damage his building and that recycling them is fun.

**Awareness message:** Through the "futuristic" design and a detailed description of each improvement obtained over the course of the game, the curious player can decide to actually adopt a "smart" element, knowing which benefits he will draw. This phase of play is a kind of "showcase" of intelligent building technologies.



## Conclusion of the game:
### Presentation - Endless game

The player can replay the sectors at will with the improvements obtained. This allows him to feel the power gain and therefore the interest of not neglecting any pillar.

**Message:** The pillars, although independent, are complementary and reveal all their interest / power when combined.

It is also a way to present a testable game in loop without obligation to launch a new game once all the pillars improved.
